# **App Name**: TOTO Forecaster

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Number Prediction: Leverage generative AI to analyze historical TOTO results and generate a ranked set of potential winning combinations, displayed to the user in order. The AI will use as one of its tools various weighted selection criteria provided by the user, or a 'weighted average' of all user criteria if so selected.
- Automatic Result Retrieval: Automatically fetch the latest TOTO results from the official Singapore Pools website.
- User-Defined Parameters: Allow users to input their own lucky numbers, weighting criteria, or number combinations for inclusion (or exclusion) in the AI's calculations.
- Automatic Win Validation: Allow users to designate a set of ticket purchases for automatic validation. The tool will flag winning combinations automatically.
- Prediction Result Display: The AI provides the results of its analysis to the end-user as an ordered list with rich UI. Each predicted number combination will be displayed with its 'score'.
- Prediction Tool System: Each tool has a different strategy (hot number method, hot and cold balance, interval coverage, odd-even control, AI prediction, etc.).
- User Number Selection + Coverage Algorithm: Users can manually select numbers or refer to system recommendations. Use coverage algorithms to generate betting combinations.
- Visualization Analysis: Hot number charts, cold number charts, odd-even/range/span analysis charts.
- User System: Collect prediction tools and numbers. Customize strategy combinations and observe hit performance.
